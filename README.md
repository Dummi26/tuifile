# TuiFile

A file explorer for your terminal, with homerow-centric navigation.

TuiFile can

- have multiple instances, one for each open directory
- display recursive directory structures
- filter files using regex
- select multiple files at once
- create new directories
- copy, move and delete
- quickly open your `$TERM` and `$EDITOR`
- add more features (open an issue with ideas if you have any)
